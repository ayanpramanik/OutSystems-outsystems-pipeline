# Adding a local agent

If your OutSystems LifeTime environment is not exposed to the Internet, you'll need to install an Azure DevOps agent on your internal network. Alternatively, you can expose your LifeTime to Azure DevOps Hosted Agents IPs. The process to install your own local agent is [described here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops#install).
